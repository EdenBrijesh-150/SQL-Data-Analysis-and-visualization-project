Project Title:

E-commerce Customer Churn Analysis Using SQL

📝 Project Description:

This project focuses on identifying and analyzing customer churn in an e-commerce business using structured query language (SQL). The goal is to uncover behavioral patterns that lead to customer attrition and generate actionable insights to help reduce future churn.

In this analysis, a customer is defined as "churned" if they have not made any purchase in the last 6 months. By examining transactional and customer data, the project segments customers based on order frequency, monetary value, and product categories purchased. It also investigates the relationship between customer behavior and churn to help the business make data-driven decisions.

🎯 Objectives:

Define customer churn based on business logic.

Identify churned customers using SQL queries.

Analyze churn trends based on order history, average order value, and frequency.

Segment customers using behavioral metrics like RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary).

Identify product categories with high churn rates.

Recommend strategies for customer retention.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies:

SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)

Database Management Systems (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL Workbench)

Optional Tools: Tableau or Power BI for data visualization

🗃️ Data Used:

Simulated or real-world e-commerce datasets consisting of the following tables:

customers: Customer profile details

orders: Order-level transaction records

order_items: Items purchased in each order

products: Product and category information

📈 Key Metrics & Analysis:

Churn Rate: Percentage of customers who stopped buying over a given period.

Recency: Days since last purchase.

Frequency: Total number of orders per customer.

Monetary Value: Total spending by each customer.

Churn by Product Category: Identify which product types see the most churn.

Customer Segmentation: Using RFM analysis for customer scoring.

🧠 Insights & Outcomes:

Identified that customers with low frequency and single-category purchases are more likely to churn.

Found that the churn rate was highest among customers with low average order value.

Suggested loyalty programs and cross-sell campaigns as retention strategies.

Created SQL views for easy access to churned customer data by marketing teams.

📤 Deliverables:

SQL scripts for data extraction, churn detection, and analysis

Analytical report with visualized insights and recommendations

Optional: Interactive dashboard (if visual tools are used)

Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

✅ Conclusion:

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to drive customer retention strategies through data-driven insights. It provides the business with a strong foundation to understand customer behavior, reduce churn, and improve overall customer lifetime value.
